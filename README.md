#Shiro
####A clean and customizable grid of cards (responsive, also for mobile).

The default look is very white, hence the name Shiro (白), but every aspect can be tailored to your likings.

The backgrounds, borders and text colors can each be chosen individually. You can also define the column width, the alignment of the sidebar and optionally a background image.
There is a small selection of widgets that can be enabled: a search bar, likes widget, following widget, twitter widget and a description widget. Infinite scrolling is included but can be turned off if you prefer pagination.

######Some options require clarification:
* Photos, photosets and videos have a fixed width, so when changing the column width you should enable the "Media Width" option that is less than or equal to the column width (300 width → 250 media width, 400 width → 400 media width). If you enable more than one "Media Width"-option your photos, photosets and videos will be displayed multiple times!


* To enable the mobile layout instead of the default one, go to Customize → Advanced options and disable "Use optimized mobile layout". When using the mobile layout it can be quite annoying that the widgets precede your posts, that is why you can choose to hide them from certain mobile pages (individual posts, search results, tag results). They will always be visible on your main pages.


* Even menu items will be displayed in the left-hand side of the menu card, whilst odd menu items will be displayed in the right-hand side. The ask and submit links have their own place at the bottom of the menu card.

- wait for localization (top, query, submit, ask)
